# Retryables Monitor

This tool is designed to assist in identifying and displaying the status of retryable tickets sent to an Arbitrum chain from its parent chain. Read more about retryable tickets [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging).

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

Additionally, ensure that you have added your Arbitrum network configuration to the `config.json` file in the `lib` directory;

## Installation

From the root directory of the project, run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Execution

### One-off Check

To find retryable tickets and display their status for a specific block range, execute the following command:

```bash
yarn dev --fromBlock=<FROM_BLOCK> --toBlock=<TO_BLOCK> [--configPath=<CONFIG_PATH>]
```

- Replace <FROM_BLOCK>, <TO_BLOCK>, and <CONFIG_PATH> with the desired block numbers and the path to your configuration file.
- If `--configPath` is not provided, it defaults to `config.json`.
- This command will identify all retryable tickets initiated or created from the parent chain to your Orbit chain within the specified block range.

### Continuous Update

To continuously monitor and update the status of retryable tickets for multiple Orbit chains concurrently, execute the following command:

```bash
yarn dev --continuous [--configPath=<CONFIG_PATH>]
```

- - Replace <CONFIG_PATH> with the path to your configuration file.
- If `--configPath` is not provided, it defaults to `config.json`.
- This command will initiate continuous monitoring, dynamically determining the block range based on the latest block on the parent chain. The tool will automatically fetch and display the status of retryable tickets for all configured Orbit chains within the `config.json` file at regular intervals.

### Error Generation and Reporting

To enable reporting, use `--enableAlerting` flag.

This will enable alerts if a retryable has not succeeded. Additionally, you might also want to log these errors to Slack, for which you will need to configure, in the `.env` file:

- `NODE_ENV=CI`
- `RETRYABLE_MONITORING_SLACK_TOKEN=<your-slack-token>`
- `RETRYABLE_MONITORING_SLACK_CHANNEL=<your-slack-channel-key>`

Check [Slack integration documentation](https://api.slack.com/quickstart) for more information about getting these auth tokens.
